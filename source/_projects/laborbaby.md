Labor baby is a company that makes baby bottles and other baby products. They approached me and my partner with the desire to have a new website.

The requirements were:

- Easy to make changes to the pages
- Multilungual functionality
- SEO ready

With these requirements me and my partner created new website.

<a href="https://www.laborbaby.it/" target="_blank">The new website of Labor baby</a> is made with WordPress and has all the functionality the client needed.
