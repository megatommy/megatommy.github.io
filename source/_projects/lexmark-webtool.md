While working as a customer service agent for Lexmark in Lisbon I developed a small offline website where I could look up information really fast about a given printer. This gave me and my colleagues the advantage of being able to help customers in an effective way. 

This app was not entirely my idea: another colleague already made a website like this, but it was harder to mantain and update information.

I built the app using Hugo (static site generator) and Bulma (CSS library). I chose Hugo because it's a standalone executable, spits out an entire website and is easy to mantain. As for the choice of Bulma, I just wanted to see how a website would look like with this library.
