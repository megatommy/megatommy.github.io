The European Juggling Convention is a week-long juggling convention which takes place once a year in the summer. It takes place in a different country each year. In 2016 the EJC was held in Almere, The Netherlands.

I helped creating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716064805/http://www.ejc2016.org/" target="_blank">the website of the EJC2016</a> by rewriting a static template to a WordPress theme. It mainly consisted of creating Page Templates and making it as easily editable as possible.
