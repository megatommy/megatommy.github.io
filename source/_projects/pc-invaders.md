[PC Invaders](https://projects.thomasdeluca.nl/game) is a game I made for a couse called Serious Games. I made this game using the HTML5 canvas.

In this game you controll an anti-virus. The files that move from the left to the right are files that are being downloaded. some of those files are malware. You have to destroy all the malware and keep your anti-virus up to date by clicking on the updates in the Notification Centre.

When you lose, you can share your score on Facebook.

Oh BTW, I got an 8.5 for it! :)
