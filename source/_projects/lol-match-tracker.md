League of Legends keeps track of the last 10 played matches. I didnâ€™t like that limit, so I wrote the [League of Legends Match Tracker][lolmh_site]. It checks my match history and puts the played matches in the database. right now it only shows you the matches I played in season 3.

This application was built before Riot released its League of Legends API. To get the necessary information I used a Web Scraping library.
