League of Legends keeps track of the last 10 played matches. I didnâ€™t like that limit, so I wrote the League of Legends Match Tracker. It checks my match history and puts the played matches in the database.

This application was built before Riot released its League of Legends API. To get the necessary information I used a web scraping library.
