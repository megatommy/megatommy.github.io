So I visit the Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam (OBA) pretty often and I don’t really like the login system.

I wrote the Open Dashboard Application (ODA) to be able to login faster. It has some nice features like remembering your card number and opening your predefined bookmarks.

You must have some basic knowledge of JSON to configure your own username and bookmarks.

[Download it here](https://projects.thomasdeluca.nl/ODA.html) (right click > Save as…) and save it on an USB drive. When you are in the OBA, connect your USB and use this file to login! It does NOT save of send any information to me, you can check the source, since it’s completely html, css and js.
