<a href="https://www.salvalazampa.eu/" target="_blank">Salva La Zampa</a> is an association which aims to protect and assist abandoned animals, offering them new hope and a better future.

Their website was made in the early 2000's and was not optimized for modern devices such as smartphones and tablets. Together, not only did we build a website which adheres to modern standards, but we also did some rebranding giving their house style and logo a modern touch.

The website consists of static pages, as well as pages that retrieve information from a database. This information is managed using a custom built CMS in ASP.net, which gives the volunteers the ability to add and update the information for each dog.

The real challenge of this project was to overhaul the frontend, while keeping the CMS and database untouched. 

Compared to the previous website, the new one is:

- Responsive
- Optimized for speed, using minified libraries and compressed images
- SEO ready
