[Info: The Gathering](https://projects.thomasdeluca.nl/mtg) visualizes some information about Magic: The Gathering sets. It shows the following information for each set:

 * How many cards a set contains.

 * How many cards of each rarity a set contains.

 * Timeline of total cards released each year.


It is written in HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, PDO (MySQL).

The libraries I used are Bootstrap, jQuery, The  Highcharts API and of course api.mtgdb.info.
