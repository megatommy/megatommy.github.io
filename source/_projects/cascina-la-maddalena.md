<a href="https://cascina-maddalena.com/" target="_blank">Cascina La Maddalena</a> is a Bed and Breakfast located in Piedmont, Italy. It offers various enotourism and agritourism activities and is situated near very typical Nothern Italian places.

Cascina La Maddalena was in need of a new website and asked me to create one. One of the requirements was to have the website available in multiple languages.

The old website was running an outdated version of WordPress on an outdated hosting provider, which affected the site speed and made it a possible target for malware. It was also using plain http, which also did not help for security and SEO.

I decided to start from scratch and bring some of the content of the old website, and to migrate the hosting to a more modern hosting provider.
