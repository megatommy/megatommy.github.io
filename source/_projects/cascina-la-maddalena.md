Cascina La Maddalena is a Bed and Breakfast located in Piedmont, Italy. It offers various enotourism and agritourism activities and is situated near very typical Nothern Italian places.

Cascina La Maddalena was in need of a new website and asked me and my partner to create one. One of the requirements was to have the website availabel in multiple languages.

The old website was runing an outdated version of WordPress on an outdated webhost, which affected the site speed and made it a possible target for malware. It was also using plain http, which also did not help for security and SEO.

We decided to start from scratch and bring some of the content of the old website, and to migrate the hosting to a more modern hosting provider.
