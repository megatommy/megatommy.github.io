<a href="https://radinext.it/" target="_blank">RadiNext</a> is a project composed of young people specialized in biotechnology, economics and design, united by the interest in proposing solutions for sustainable land management.

The team creates a connection between scientific approach, social economy and design, studying cutting-edge solutions and proposals for circular management of resources.

RadiNext was the winner of the regranting call promoted by LVIA for Emilia Romagna, to promote activities for the promotion of sustainability and regenerative agriculture in the territories of Forl√¨-Cesena.

The project is growing and was in need of a website. The website needed to be simple with enough information about RadiNext and what they do.
