[The SteamGifts EasyEnter](https://www.github.com/megatommy/Steamgifts-Easyenter
) is a Google Chrome extension which automatically enters the giveaways you click on steamgifts.com.
This is the first extension I ever wrote and it’s still in beta.
It does its job good enough to use it. You can download it [on Github](https://www.github.com/megatommy/Steamgifts-Easyenter
). Since it’s not available on in the Chrome Web Store, you have to install it manually.
