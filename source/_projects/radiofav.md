I chose to build <a href="https://radiofav.thomasdeluca.nl/" target="_blank">Radiofav</a> using the Laravel framework, so I could understand how this framework works.

Radiofav enables you to bookmark a song you are currently listening to, if you're using <a href="https://radiofav.thomasdeluca.nl/supported-services" target="_blank">one of the services it supports</a>. Think of Radiofav like Pocket, but for songs. Thanks to this project I've become quite familiar with Laravel and made me understand how important it is to use a framework.
