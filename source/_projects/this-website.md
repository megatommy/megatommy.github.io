This website is being hosted on Github Pages, which means I update it with a text editor, and push it to GitHub. GitHub Pages uses a static site generator named <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.

I built this website theme from scratch, although I got some inspiration from here and there. I try to make it as lightweight as possible by using CDNs, minifying my images and using plain JS (the functionality is minimal). This way it loads blazing fast, even on mobile and in areas where internet access is slow.

I use(d) this project to get comfortable with managing DNS settings and to learn how Jekyll works.
