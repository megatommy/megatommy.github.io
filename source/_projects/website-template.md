For me a website is a playground where the site itself is an axpression of yourself. This website I made is simple, easy to use and experimental. I started thinking about different ways to present content to the world. A way that is different from the millions of websites worldwide. Also, I wanted to experiment with animation. Well, those things combined brought me to this website template.

This template uses jQuery to slide up and down. Therefore it may not work on some mobile devices. But oh well, it’s just an experiment so I don’t really care about it.
