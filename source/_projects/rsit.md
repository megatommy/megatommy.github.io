The [RuneScape Item Tracker (RSIT)](https://projects.thomasdeluca.nl/rsit) makes it easier for Runescape players to keep an eye on items they might want to buy. The applications uses LocalStorage to know which items to track. This way people donâ€™t need to make an account to use this application.

The RuneScape Item Tracker tracks the price of today, the price change and the profit or loss you make if you sell the item now.

It uses the Grand Exchange API to get the data. For more information visit the FAQ on the site of the app itself.
