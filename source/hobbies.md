Aside from web developing, I have some other hobbies.

## Juggling

I really enjoy to juggle in my spare time aswell. The video here is a compilation of small video's I made while I travalled in Italy, Spain and Finland in 2015-2016.

## Bleaching T-shirts

Watching some YouTube I learned how to bleach T-shirt with custom images. I really liked the concept of it, and gave it a try. The pictures here are just some of the T-shirts I made.
